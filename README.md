# Hydra [Sam Thursfield's fork]

This is a fork of Olivia Jack's [Hydra](https://github.com/ojack/hydra/) visual synthesizer.

For information about Hydra, see [the upstream README file](https://github.com/ojack/hydra/).

## Recording videos

This fork adds a 'record' button to the menu, which can be used to export
videos of your Hydra performance.

Start recording by pushing the record button. It will turn into a stop button.
When you press stop, you'll be offered a download of a .webm file containing
what was recorded.

Code is in [sam/record branch](https://github.com/ssssam/hydra/tree/sam/record).
